    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <h2> Grade 10 Students of the Junior High School Department of the University of <br>Nueva Caceres' Preference for Medium of Learning Materials (Printed or Online) and Their Impact on the Mitigation of Deforestation</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="justifier">  Different artificial or man-made crises have plagued the world throughout history and continue to do so today, endangering the welfare of many populations in numerous ways, such as deforestation focally spawned by humans. Among the innumerable purposes of the woodcut during deforestation is to provide papers for the production of learning materials. Contemporarily, a significant portion of human civilization is eager in learning more about how these paper consumptions can be reduced. Thus, being one with them, the researchers of this study peeked at how well-versed the chosen student populace is with the impact of their preference on the medium of learning materials to use in the mitigation of deforestation.</p>
        
    <p class="justifier">This study investigated the prior knowledge possessed by the one hundred seventy-five (175) students in all of the eight sections of Grade 10 of the University of Nueva Caceres in relation to their demographic profiles (Age, Section, Sexuality, and Locality), their preference between the two mediums under varying categories (Affordability, Availability, Comfortability, Effectivity, and Eco-Friendliness), the presence of a significant relationship between their demographic profiles and preference to the mitigation of deforestation, and the respondents’ recommendation or proposals to enhance their awareness of deforestation and its mitigation to generate an Anti-Deforestation Plan, a Website, and the Gryffindor Paper Generator.</p>
    
    <p class="justifier"> The research instrument known as a questionnaire in a survey form was used to collect the data, which was then evaluated using the research treatments Percentage Distribution, Weighted Mean, Chi-Square, Mann-Whitney U Test, and Likert Scale. 
    All methods performed, the evaluated data showed that the majority of respondents were females aged fifteen to sixteen (15–16) who are residents of Camarines Sur province, having a one-to-zero difference in the number of respondents per section. Additionally, it was discovered that the students' ratings of competency were set at a sufficiently proficient level, with a weighted mean of 3.9775. Moreover, using both Chi-Square and the Mann-Whitney U Test, it has been proven that there is a significant connection between both the students' demographic profiles and preference for the medium of learning materials to use and its impact on the mitigation of deforestation. And for the listed recommendations, the respondents strongly agree with them as proven by the weighted mean of 4.39, and therefore indicated that all of the listed recommendations should be incorporated into the Anti-Deforestation Plan.</p>

     <br>
    <div class="Procedure">
    <div class="pro">
        <ol>
        <li> The materials listed above will be prepared</li>
        <li> Upon completion, the four (4) major parts of the Gryffindor Paper Generator will be assembled; Shredding Area, Blending Area, Soaking Area, and Straining/Drying Area.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
        <dl>
        <li><dt>Shredding Area</dt><dd>-Create a blade out of metal sheets by forming them into a circle and drilling a hole through the center so that an acme screw can be inserted. The desired size of the group determines the size of the blades.</dd></li>
        <dd>-It is much preferable to manually and evenly sharpen the blades using a stone or carborundum sharpener.</dd>
        <dd> -A wooden circle that will serve as a divider for the blades to be inserted is also required. The wood will need to be smaller than the size of the blade and must have a hole in the center </dd>
        <dd>-Insert the completed blade output into the torque, secure the wiring, and then insert the boots and holders that will be attached to the product's main switch.</dd>
        <dd>-After completing all of these steps, check the wiring to make sure it is functional and securely fastened so that connecting it to the switch can be completed immediately.</dd>
            
            </dl>
        </ul>
    </div>
        <div class="pro">
        <ul>
        <dl>
        <li><dt>Blending Area</dt> <dd> The Blending Area will be placed on the left-most part of the output; it will have an open left side measuring 30 inches, a width of 10 inches, a division of 13 and 2 inches from the Shredding and Soaking Area, and a Blender built inside.</dd></li>
        <li>Soaking Area <dd>The Soaking Area will be located below the Shredding Area, but with a division of 25 inches of cardboard horizontally, and with a height and width of 20 inches. Placed there will be a 3-liter Plastic Box Container that will be retractable for the next process.</dd></li>    
        <li>Straining/Drying Area <dd>The last group of steps to assemble the Straining or Drying Area is to prepare 10 Barbecue Sticks; 2 tied with each other to form 5 pairs. The 5 Paper Frames will be then connected to the sticks with the use of 4 lines of yarn tied with each of the corners per Paper Frame. On the bottom of the structure, a 50 inches Corrugated Metal Aluminum Sheet will be placed for faster drying of the papers as the received heat from the sun will bounce back to the papers.</dd></li>
           
        </dl>
        </ul>  
    </div>
    <div class="pro">
        <ol>
        <li>After assembling all the major parts, it will be turned into an output having a base width of 80 inches, and three divisions measuring 10 by 30 inches, 20 by 40 inches, and 50 by 35 inches.</li>   
        <li>The first step of the generation will be to insert used or recycled papers into the Shredding Area.</li>
        <li>All the shredded papers will be measured to exactly go into the blender primarily filled with water; then, the blender will be turned on until the shredded papers will be crumbled into pieces.</li>
        <li>After blending the papers, the left side of the Blending Area will be manually opened for the Blender to be tilted and measured as well exactly for the crumbled papers to shoot into the Soaking Area filled with hot water for further breaking down of papers located below the Shredding Area.</li>  
        <li>The paper crumbles will remain soaked in hot water for 30 minutes. And beyond that, the Plastic Box Container will be contracted and using the Barbecue Sticks tied with the Paper Frames, it will be dipped to fish out the pieces of paper and will be hung on the Straining/Drying Area.</li>
        <li>The drying process will take 30 minutes; and after, 5 papers will be generated at once.</li>
